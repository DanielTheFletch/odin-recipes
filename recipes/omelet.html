      This seaside dish combines savory crab meat with filling cooked rice to create an
      immaculate flavor. Although the recipe dates back to Hyrule's earliest days, it has 
      now become a staple among residents of Lurelin Village.

      As Described in Hyrule:
      <blockquote>
        "The fluffy crab legs pair perfectly with the rice for a truly scrumptious dish."
